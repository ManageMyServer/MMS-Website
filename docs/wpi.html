    <h5>Last updated: Friday, January 27, 2017</h5>
    <h5>Getting Started</h5>
    Now that you have downloaded the web panel for ManageMyServer (<a href="/get.html">if you have not, click here</a>), you can start the installation of the web panel. First off, you need a web server with PHP 5.5+ and a MySQL server that you have root access to.<br>
    <h5>Setting up the panel</h5>
    To install, extract the files from the zip folder that you downloaded into the root directory of your web server (you cannot put ManageMyServer in a subfolder.) Open up your browser and navigate to your web servers' website. You should be greeted by the installer. If you are not, navigate to [your web server]/install.php and you will be at the installer.<br>
    <h5>Install/Access ManageMyServer</h5>
    Now that you have gotten into the installer, follow the instructions on the screen until you reach the end of the installer. At the end, you will be redirected to the login page. To login to the panel, use the default login information.<br><br>
    <strong>Default login information:</strong><br>
    <strong>Username:</strong> admin<br>
    <strong>Password:</strong> password<br><br>
    We highly recomend you change this login information in the admin panel. Simply click admin in the navigational bar and then click users and finally click the user admin, or navigate to [your web server]/admin/users/user/?id=1 in your web browser.<br>
    <h5>You did it!</h5>
    Now that you have successfully installed the web panel you need to <a href="/docs/nai.html">install the node application to use the panel. Click here to check that out.</a>
