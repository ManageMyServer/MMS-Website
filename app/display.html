 List of things to do: (All in <span class="red-color">red</span> are urgent)<br>
 - Nodes system (In progress)<br>
 - Servers system (In progress)<br>
 - <span class="red-color">Application to run servers/nodes (In progress)</span><br>
 <br>
 Quick note:<br>
 - We need someone to make the node/server application. We can't continue if we don't have it! (<a href="https://github.com/ManageMyServer/MMS-Java-App">Link to Github</a>, Java knowledge required)<br>
